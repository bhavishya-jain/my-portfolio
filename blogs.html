          <h1>ES6 Features</h1>
          <small>September, 2021</small>
          <p>
            I am going to share some of the usefule ES6 features which can help write better code :

1. Template Literals :

We can now use back-ticks (`) for writing strings and to pass a value, we can use ${value}, for example :

let name = `Your full name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`

2. Destructuring

It is a Javascript expression that can extract values from arrays or objects into a new variable. For example,

const obj = { firstName: 'abc', lastName: 'xyz' };
const { firstName, lastName } = obj;

3. Arrow functions

The advantage of using arrow function is that, 'this' will have the same value as in the context of the function. For example,

const a = () => console.log('Hello');

4. Promises

Promises provide us with asynchronous execution. For example,

var asyncExample =  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   // do something
   resolve();
}).then(()=> {  
   console.log('Successful');
})

5. let and const

These allow us to scope the variable to a block. For example,

function exampleFunc(bool) {
   let count= 0;
   if(bool) {
      let count = 1; // scope ends here for count
   }
   return count;
}
console.log(exampleFunc(true)); // output: 0

          <h1>Solid Principles</h1>
          <small>September, 2021</small>
          <p>
            I am going to share what are SOLID Principles in my understanding :

1. Single responsibility principle

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.
This means decoupling the unrelated functionalities and separating them into different classes.

2. Open-closed principle

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This should be used only when the requirements are reasonable predictable to us.
The code should be isolated from requirements change

3. Liskov substitution principle

Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
If the code is going to be consumed by others, then this becomes important.

4. Interface segregation principle

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

5. Dependency inversion principle

Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
